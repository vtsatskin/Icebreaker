Mayank: We move fast, we break things, we hack for a day straight, and we're proud. We're engineers, and somehow we still suck at meeting people. But maybe the problem isn't with us, first impressions are hard, meeting the right people is even harder. 

Ammir: We came here to meet great people, and as much as it sucks that we had to spend 24 hours to figure out how, we think we've got it.
