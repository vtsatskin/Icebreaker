Icebreaker
==========

Mayank: We move fast, we break things, we hack for a day straight, and we're proud. We're engineers, and somehow we still suck at meeting people. But maybe the problem isn't with us, first impressions are hard, meeting the right people is even harder. 

Amir: This is my first Hackathon and I was hoping to meet similar minded people. I didn't have a team and I didn't know anyone here.
Wouldn't it be great if I could join a group and it could match me with people with similar interests. It'd even tell me exactly what to say to them to get a conversation going.
